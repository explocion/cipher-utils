# `cipher-utils` for ECE475 Challenge 2

## Examples

In the `examples` folder, you can find `caesar`, which is an implementation of Caesar cipher. It will show how to use the traits and macros defined in `cipher` and this crate to develop your own block cipher. You can also run `cargo test --example=caesar` to see how the test framework works.
